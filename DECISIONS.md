# libycxx design decisions

## 1. Preprocessor policy (strict)

C++26 gives us `if constexpr`, `consteval`, concepts, `requires`, pack indexing, alias and
variable templates. The preprocessor is used only where the language cannot do the job.

**Rules**

1. **One detection point.** `include/ycxx/config.hpp` is the only file that inspects compiler,
   target or language-mode macros (`__clang__`, `__GNUC__`, `__cpp_exceptions`,
   `__SIZEOF_INT128__`, `__has_builtin`, `__STDCPP_FLOAT16_T__`, ...).
2. **Convert once, then use the language.** Each answer becomes a `constexpr` value in
   `ycxx::detail::cfg` (`cfg::clang`, `cfg::exceptions`, `cfg::hardened`, ...) or a type alias or
   alias template in `ycxx::detail` (`int128`, `float16`, `remove_ref_t`, `make_integer_seq`, ...).
   Library code consumes them with `if constexpr`, `requires`, and templates.
   An unavailable type aliases a distinct incomplete type (`fp_unavailable<N>`,
   `int128_unavailable`), so type lists and overload sets stay well-formed without `#if`.
3. **No library macros.** The library defines no function-like macros, no attribute macros
   (write `[[gnu::always_inline]]`, `[[gnu::cold]]` directly; both compilers accept them), and no
   "shorthand" macros (no `FWD(x)`; write `static_cast<T&&>(x)`). The only macros the library
   defines are:
   - those the standard mandates (`NULL`, `offsetof`, `INT_MAX`, `INT32_C`, `__cpp_lib_*`,
     `assert`, `errno`, ...), and
   - the `YCXX_*` switches in `config.hpp` (user-settable `YCXX_HARDENED`; parse-level
     `YCXX_HAS_*` switches).
4. **`#if` outside `config.hpp` only when the code cannot be parsed or declared otherwise.**
   Examples: a declaration that needs a builtin only one compiler has
   (`std::is_within_lifetime` needs `__builtin_is_within_lifetime`), a `throw` expression under
   `-fno-exceptions`, or a standard macro whose value must be usable inside `#if`. Such an `#if`
   tests a `YCXX_HAS_*` switch, never a compiler name. Prefer restructuring (an out-of-line
   function, a dependent expression) over adding an `#if`.
   **Probing builtins without the preprocessor.** A function-style builtin is detected with a
   concept over a dependent call, e.g.
   `template <class T> concept has_is_within_lifetime = requires(const T* p) { __builtin_is_within_lifetime(p); };`.
   If the builtin does not exist, the call is an ordinary failed lookup and the concept is false
   (verified on GCC 16.2 and Clang 23.1). These probes live in `ycxx::detail::builtin` in
   `config.hpp`. The library entity is then declared unconditionally with a `requires` clause,
   so no `#if` is needed. Type-taking builtins (`__is_integral(T)`, `__builtin_type_order(T, U)`)
   cannot be probed this way: an unknown one is a hard parse error. They still need
   `__has_builtin` in `config.hpp`. `__cpp_lib_*` macros still need a preprocessor switch
   because they must be usable in `#if`.
5. **Builtins stay inside trait definitions.** Compiler trait builtins (`__is_constructible`, ...)
   appear only in the definitions of `std::` traits, `ycxx::detail` variable templates, and
   concepts. Function signatures (return types, `requires`, `noexcept`, `explicit`) use the
   `_v` traits or concepts. GCC rejects builtins in mangled signatures, and named concepts are
   needed anyway for constraint subsumption. For the same reason the public `_t` aliases go
   through their class templates (`remove_cv_t<T> = typename remove_cv<T>::type`), because user
   code puts them in signatures.
6. **`#pragma once`** instead of include guards.
7. **Preconditions are a function, not a macro.** `ycxx::detail::precondition(cond, msg)` is
   `constexpr`. It always diagnoses a violation during constant evaluation, and checks at run
   time when `YCXX_HARDENED=1` (via `cfg::hardened`).

8. **Keep looking for replacements.** Every remaining preprocessor use is technical debt. When a
   new language feature or an in-language probe can replace one, replace it.

Rationale: `if constexpr` branches are type-checked, so both configurations stay compilable.
Templates and constants respect scope and namespaces, show up in diagnostics, and are visible to
tooling.

## 2. Namespaces and naming

- Standard entities are declared directly in `namespace std` (no inline versioning namespace).
  No ABI compatibility with libstdc++ or libc++ is attempted.
- Implementation details live in `ycxx::detail` with `snake_case` names. Detail namespaces
  avoid generic names that ADL could pick up (`swap`, `begin`, `get`); CPOs live in their own
  sub-namespaces (`ycxx::detail::swap_cpo`).
- Template parameters and locals use plain names (`T`, `first`), not reserved `_Ugly` names.
  Known deviation: a user macro that collides with such a name, defined before including a
  libycxx header, can break the header.

## 3. Freestanding layering

- `include/ycxx/core/**`: no OS, no libc headers, no heap unless an allocator is supplied, and
  no dependency on `<exception>`/`<typeinfo>`. C types and macros (`<cstddef>`, `<cstdint>`,
  `<climits>`) are defined from compiler-predefined macros only.
- `include/ycxx/hosted/**` plus `src/hosted`: anything needing the OS, reached only through the PAL.
- `include/ycxx/pal.h`: C-linkage platform hooks (`ycxx_pal_allocate`, `_write`, `_abort`,
  `_clock_now`, ...). `src/pal/posix` implements them on top of libc.

## 4. Error handling

- Every library "throw" goes through `ycxx::detail::raise(kind, what)`.
  - With exceptions on, it calls `ycxx::detail::throw_std`, defined out of line in the hosted
    runtime, which throws the standard exception type. Core headers therefore never include
    `<stdexcept>`.
  - With `-fno-exceptions`, it calls `extern "C" ycxx_error_handler(kind, what)`. The default
    definition is a weak symbol emitted from the header that calls `__builtin_trap()`; a strong
    user definition replaces it at link time with no library rebuild.
- The language-support ABI (`__cxa_*`, `std::type_info`, `std::exception` vtables, unwinding)
  comes from the toolchain's ABI runtime (GCC's `libsupc++` plus `libgcc_s`/`libgcc_eh`), which
  is linked for both compilers. Our declarations of `std::exception`, `std::type_info`, etc.
  follow the Itanium C++ ABI layout.

## 5. Compiler-builtin portability

Some trait builtins exist only on Clang (`__is_integral`, `__make_signed`, `__array_extent`,
...). These traits are implemented portably once in `ycxx/core/prim_traits.hpp` and
`ycxx/core/type_traits.hpp`. A builtin is used directly only when both compilers provide it
under the same name. Otherwise it gets one alias template in `config.hpp`.

| Feature | GCC 16.2 | Clang 23.1 | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| `__builtin_is_within_lifetime` | no | yes | `std::is_within_lifetime` usable on Clang only (constraint) |
| `__builtin_is_corresponding_member` / `..._with_class` | yes | no | usable on GCC only (constraint) |
| `__builtin_type_order` | yes | no | `std::type_order` via a portable fallback (TBD) |

## 6. Development process

1. **Small commits.** One logical change per commit, with conformance test-count deltas in the
   message where relevant.
2. **Review every commit (P0–P2).** After committing, review that commit's diff:
   - **P0**: wrong behaviour, crashes, UB, build breaks, or a layering or policy violation
     (core reaching hosted/libc, preprocessor policy).
   - **P1**: conformance bugs (wrong constraints, `noexcept`, `explicit`, missing overloads),
     ODR or ABI hazards, missing `constexpr` where the standard requires it.
   - **P2**: notable quality issues: performance traps, dead code, misleading comments,
     missing tests.
3. **Fix, then commit again.** Review fixes go in a separate follow-up commit
   ("Review fixes for <commit>: ...") so history records what was wrong. Amend only for trivial
   fixes (typos, formatting), and only if the commit has not been pushed yet.
4. **Our own "pure" test suite (`tests/ycxx`).** Tests for new behaviour (C++23/26-era features
   and anything the two borrowed suites do not cover) are written by an independent author who
   may read only the working draft and cppreference.com. The author never sees libc++ or
   libstdc++ tests, or any implementation, libycxx's own included. A failing pure test is
   treated as a library bug until the draft shows otherwise; tests are never weakened to fit
   the library. Run with `tools/run-conformance ycxx gcc|clang`.
   - **The test author always runs.** One spec-only test-author agent is kept running in the
     background at all times, relaunched as soon as a batch finishes. It does two things:
     (a) widens coverage on its own, walking the draft for clauses of already-implemented
     headers that have no pure test yet; (b) takes nudges from current work. Whenever a header
     is being implemented or reworked, the agent is told which draft sections (stable names)
     that work covers, and those sections come first. The nudge names sections only, never
     files or code.
   - Each batch is committed on its own ("Own test suite: ..."), failures and all, before the
     library fixes, which go in a separate commit.
   - A failure caused by a missing compiler builtin is marked `// XFAIL-COMPILER: gcc|clang
     <reason>` and listed under compiler gaps in `STATUS.md`. The test body stays unchanged and
     reports XPASS once the compiler catches up.
5. **Gate before pushing:** `tools/check-all`, plus the affected conformance directories on
   both compilers and both suites.
